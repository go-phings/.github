# go-phings

Welcome to Go Phings! This repository is home to a collection of open-source libraries written in Go, created to simplify and enhance application development. You’ll find a lightweight library for building command-line applications, a module for easily creating CRUD HTTP endpoints from structs, a struct-to-database mapping tool (similar to an ORM), and much more.

These libraries have been used extensively in tools for infrastructure and automation and are now shared with the community to benefit developers everywhere.

Each project is actively evolving, with development roadmaps for 2025 to be announced soon—stay tuned!
